# BuckleScript/Cycle.js Test Project

## Development

### Setup

    brew install ninja

and

    npm install

or

    yarn

### Run

In one terminal window, run `npm run watch` or `yarn run watch`.

In another terminal window, run `npm run dev-server` or `yarn run
dev-server`.

Browse to http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/

## Production

You don't need BuckleScript to try out the webapp. If you haven't
already, just run `npm install` or `yarn`. Then, run `npm run pack` or
`yarn run pack`. The output is `build/bundle.js`. The static web page is
`build/index.html`; open that to check the results.
